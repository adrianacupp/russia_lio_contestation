# russia_lio_contestation
how has the concept of world-order changed to Russia policy makers in 20 years?

To further explore the changing semantic relationships between LIO contestation typologies and “world order” over time, I employ computational text-as-data methods in an original corpus (6649 documents including speeches, addresses, interviews and statements) from the President of Russia (2003-2023) and the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs (2004-2023). 

Because the goal is to track the semantics of a word ("world_order"), word vectors and naive time series appear a useful method to study changing historical meanings of political concepts to authoritarian regimes, and consequently, how their foreign policy has changed over time.
